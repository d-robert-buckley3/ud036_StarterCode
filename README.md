# Movie Trailer Site

This exercise was to demonstrate the creation of one's own class.  We created a new class 'Movie', added some variable to it for movie info, then added a method of playing the movie's trailer on YouTube.

Later we imported another file, fresh_tomatoes.py, which takes a list of our Movie objects and creates a web site out of them.

### Requirements

The script relies on another file, fresh_tomatoes.py which is available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py).
