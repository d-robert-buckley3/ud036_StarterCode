# Movie Trailer Site

This exercise demonstrates the creation of one's own class.  We created a new class 'Movie', added some variables to it for movie info, then added a method of playing the movie's trailer on YouTube.

Later we imported another file, fresh_tomatoes.py, which takes a list of our Movie objects and creates a web site out of them.
